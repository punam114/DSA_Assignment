        <h4>A contact page should clearly provide users with various ways to get in touch with your business, including email, phone number, physical address, and social media links. It's also helpful to include a contact form, a live chat option, and an FAQ section to address common queries. Consider adding a location map if you have a physical store and include your operation hours. </h4>
        <h5>In my time working in customer experience, I’ve learned that customers must be able to contact you when they want to. If they can’t, chances are they’re going to be pretty unhappy.
This is why having a great “Contact Us” page on your company’s website is so important. By providing an easy-to-navigate Contact Us page, you ensure your customers can easily reach the right department at the right time to address their needs.</h5>
