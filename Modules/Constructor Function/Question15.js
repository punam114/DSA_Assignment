// Create a factory function createLibrary that manages a collection of books in a library. 
// Each library should allow for adding new books, removing books by title, and displaying all 
// available books. Implement helper factory functions for creating Book objects, which include 
// properties title and author, and a method details() to print the book’s details.

// Steps:

// 1.Define the Book factory function with title, author, and a details() method.
// 2.Define the createLibrary factory function that returns an object with methods to:
// 3.Add a book to the collection.
// 4.Remove a book by title.
// 5.List all books by calling each book’s details() method.
// 6.Implement createLibrary to store books in an internal array.
